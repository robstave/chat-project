# test-bot1 — Ducky Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot powered by Google Gemini, with the persona of Ducky — a mischievous boy sphynx cat.

> **Note:** This is a personal project. It's wired up to my own private AWS Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables for the `/stats` command — you won't be able to use that part out of the box. That said, the bot architecture, persona system, and command structure are a solid starting point if you want to build something similar. Feel free to study it for ideas, but don't expect a straight copy-paste to just work.

## Running the Bot

### Option A — Local Dev (run.sh)

`run.sh` handles venv creation, dependency install, and startup automatically.

> **If you copied this project from another directory**, delete the old `.venv` first —
> virtual environments contain hardcoded paths and aren't portable:
> ```bash
> rm -rf .venv
> ```

1. Copy the example env file and fill in your values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env — set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, GEMINI_APIKEY, ADMIN_HANDLE
   ```

2. Add yourself to `allowed.md`:
   ```
   @yourhandle
   ```

3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

   The script will:
   - Create `.venv` if it doesn't exist
   - Source `.env`
   - Install / upgrade dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Start `bot.py`

   Logs are written to `./logs/bot.log`.

---

### Option B — Docker (recommended for production)

1. Copy and fill in your env file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env — set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, GEMINI_APIKEY, ADMIN_HANDLE
   ```

2. Add yourself to `allowed.md`:
   ```
   @yourhandle
   ```

3. Create the host log directory:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/log/ducky-bot
   ```

4. Build and start:
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Tail logs:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   # or directly from the mounted log file:
   tail -f /var/log/ducky-bot/bot.log
   ```

6. Stop:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

   The container restarts automatically on reboot (`restart: unless-stopped`).
   Logs are mounted from `/var/log/ducky-bot/` on the host → `/app/logs/` in the container.

## Configuration

### Environment variables (`.env`)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) |
| `GEMINI_APIKEY` | Google Gemini API key |
| `ADMIN_HANDLE` | Your Telegram `@handle` — has permanent full access |
| `LOG_DIR` | *(optional)* Directory for `bot.log`. Defaults to `./logs`. |

### Access control (`allowed.md`)

Only Telegram users whose `@handle` appears in `allowed.md` (or whose handle matches `ADMIN_HANDLE`) can use the bot. All other messages are silently ignored.

- One `@handle` per line — the `@` prefix is optional
- Lines starting with `#` are comments
- The file is re-read on every access check — **no restart needed** to add or remove users
- The admin handle (from `.env`) always has access regardless of this file

Example `allowed.md`:
```
# Friends
@alice
@bob
```

Every access attempt is logged with `GRANTED [admin]`, `GRANTED [user]`, or `DENIED`.

### Persona (`persona.md`)

Ducky's personality is defined in `persona.md`. It is read fresh on every LLM call and injected as the system prompt. Edit it to change how Ducky behaves — no restart needed.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Greet the bot and get started. |
| `/ping` | Check if the bot is alive. Responds with `pong`. |
| `/add <a> <b>` | Add two numbers together. Example: `/add 3 5` → `3 + 5 = 8` |
| `/timer <seconds>` | Set a countdown timer. When it expires the bot sends a duck photo. Example: `/timer 60` |
| `/fortune` | Ask Ducky for a whimsical daily fortune, delivered with a duck photo. |
| `/calotto` | Generate California SuperLotto Plus numbers. Ducky writes a lucky cat haiku, which is hashed to seed the RNG, producing 5 numbers (1–47) plus a Mega number (1–27). |
| `/f5lottery` | Generate California Fantasy 5 numbers. Same haiku-seeded approach, producing 5 numbers (1–39). |
| `/commands` | Show the list of available commands (sent as a Markdown-formatted message). |
| `/stats list` | List all available metric IDs for your user. |
| `/stats <metric>` | Show the last 10 events for a metric (e.g. `/stats weight-scale`). |
| `/stats set <metric> <value> [MM/DD]` | Record a new value for a metric, optionally with a specific date. |

### Stats aliases

| Alias | Resolves to |
|-------|-------------|
| `steps` | `steps-iphone` |
| `weight` | `weight-scale` |

The `/stats` command talks to an external AWS API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB backend. The relevant environment variables are:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AWS_API_URL` | Base URL of the API Gateway endpoint |
| `AWS_API_KEY` | API key sent as `x-api-key` header |
| `AWS_USER` | Username to query. Defaults to the Telegram sender's handle if unset. |

All commands require access — unauthorized users receive no response.

The command list shown by `/commands` is loaded from `commands.md` at the project root — edit it to update what users see.

## Logging

Logs are written to `$LOG_DIR/bot.log` using Python's `RotatingFileHandler`:

- **Max size:** 5 MB per file
- **Backups:** 3 (i.e. `bot.log`, `bot.log.1`, `bot.log.2`, `bot.log.3`)
- **Docker mount:** `/var/log/ducky-bot/` on the host → `/app/logs/` in the container
